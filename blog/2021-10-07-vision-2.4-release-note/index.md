It's been 3 weeks since we released version 2.3. In the last version, we marked our critical milestone that launched Pro features which let us start to get revenue. It turned out that the result excceeded our expectation. We really appreciate your support.

<!--truncate-->

During the 3 weeks, we have learned deeper about OKRs, whcih enabled us to correct some features and usages that not suitable for some scenario. Meanwile, we launched our offical website (https://getvisionapp.com), and finished our documentation for users. And we plan to invest more time into making content to let our users easier to get start with Vision and OKRs.

## Improvements of Key Results

In the latest version of Vision, we strongly emphasized that _the Key Results are results_, which are not tasks, not the concrete things you should do. We don't care about their process, but results. And for most of part, we can only know if we achieve the results when the cycle ends.

We've also removed the concepts of "Measureable Key Results" and "MileStone Key Results", and introduced **Initial Value**, **Target Value**.

With these values, we can make some key results like "Loose weight from 90kg to 70kg" easier to record. Obviously, the initial value here is 90, and the target value is 70. And each time the value ("quantity" in the previous version) you add with your records is simply the weight value you just weigh.

Besides, we introduced **Calculation** for your key results, which is the method to calculate the final value of the key results from the records. You can choose from **Last Value**, **Average**, **Sum** and so on. In the previous versions, the calculation was _Sum_, means that the final value of a key result is the sum of all records value (quantity). However, as of the "loosing weight" example above, we should choose _Last Value_ as its calculation. Because we don't care how your weight was changing during the cycle, we only care if your last value reaches your target value at the end of the cycle.

:::info
We'll automatically migrate your old key results to the new key results with initial value is 0, target value is the total quantity, and the calculation is _Sum_.

Moreover, as we realized that key results are results, we removed the feature that _finishing tasks can automatically add records_. Because there is no direct relation between tasks and key results.

## What does Vision Focus on

It seems that the change in the version 2.4 is small, but it means a lot for us. We could have focused on the task feature if we didn't receive the feedback from a US based user, who began to use Vision since 1.0, which "criticized" us that we had deviated from making an OKR app by focusing on tasks. He then sent us some links from which he learn OKRs. And it turned out to be the "savior" for us.

People can easily find a task management app, to-do app, even a project management app that meets their needs in the market, but Vision is not meant to be one of them. Vision's goal is to help people manage their goals in a **big way**, not small way. We believe that only with the vision (or ultimate goal) in your mind that guides you, you can do better in concrete tasks.

Therefore, we will continue to focus on the features and experiences on OKRs, even on the personal vision level. And the task feature is not our priority for now.

# OKR Introduction

## What is an OKR

[OKR] is short for Objectives and Key Results. It is a popular goal management framework, which comes from companies. And Vision aims to bring OKRs to personal use.

An OKR consists of an **Objective**, which tells you where to go, and several **Key Results**, which are the results you need to achieve to get to your Objective. At Vision, we introduced another concept, **Tasks**, which are all the projects and tasks that will help you achieve your Key Results.

## A Brief History of OKR and Vision

- In 1954, Peter Drucker invented MBO (Management by Objectives)
- In 1968, [Andrew Grove], then CEO and co-founder of Intel, developed MBO into the OKR framework as we know it today.
- In 1974, [John Doerr] joined Intel and learned OKR during his time here.
- John Doerr introduced OKR to Larray Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google, who then implemented OKR at Google (which still uses it today).
- In 2020, Peter, CEO of ApeUni, introduced OKR to his company.
- In October 2020, Kai, who was a Web developer at ApeUni, found that OKRs were valubale for personal use, which helped his transition to an iOS indie developer, and launched Vision 1.0 afterwards.
- In June 2021, Vision 2.0 was launched.

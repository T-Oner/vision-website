# Key Results

English version is coming soon...

<!-- ## What are Key Results

If objectives are the place you are heading for, key results are the proofs of why you are already there. Key Results are like exams which are only focus on the score you finally get, rather than the process of how hard you've tried to prepare for them.

### They are Results

Key Results, as the name implies, are results, the results you finally get when the Cycle ends, rather than what you've actually done during the Cycle.

Now, let's look at this example of an OKR:

> Objective: Recover from Suboptimal health to health

> - KR1: Loose weight from 70kg to 60kg
> - KR2: Sleep at least 7 hours on average
> - KR3: Achieve at least 5 times 5-km-run at a minimum average speed of 4 minutes per kilometer
> - KR4: Have a check-up with all indicators are normal.

We go through them one by one to tell why they are results:

1. _Loosing weight to 60kg_ is a typical result that you can only get when the cycle ends. Because we don't care how your weight goes up or down during the cycle, we only care whether your weight is 60kg or not at the end of the cycle.
2. Measuring an average value of something is another typical type of results for you can't get all the records until the cycle ends to calculate the average value.
3. The key for this KR is the limitation modifier of the speed. With the modifer, you can't achieve it unless having a series of training, which may requires you to run 20 times of 5km in order to reach that speed.
4. Quite obvious, the _all indicators are normal_ is a result. You may achieve this by making a lot of efforts, even having check-ups more than once.

##### Pro Tip: the Limitation Modifier for Key Results

What makes the 3rd and 4th key results above a result is that they all include a **limitation modifier**, such as the limitation of _the average speed _, and _all indicators are normal_. If we remove the modifiers from them, the key results are becoming like simple actions or the actual things you need to do, less like results.

One more example is that

> KR: Read 100 pages of _Algorithm_, understand them.

If we take out the modifier "_understand them_", it's simply a task instead of key result -- you may read more than once in order to understand them.
